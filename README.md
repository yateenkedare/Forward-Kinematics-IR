# Forward-Kinematics-IR
Program to calculate the Transformation matrix for every joint in a robot using the DH parameters.\n
This program also calculates the Transformation matrix of the end manipulator with respect to the base.\n
The X-Y-Z Cartesian angles of the end effectors are also calculated.
